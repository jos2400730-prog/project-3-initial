The AI analysis was very helpful, because it helped 
me at most every step. First, I was able to see through the 
code skeleton what I needed to make, then I was able to use the 
AI, in this case I chose ChatGPT, to correct any initial mistakes. 
It led to a much easier process that what my usual process looks like
I'll admit, especially when pasting my code as well as the log when an error occurred.
